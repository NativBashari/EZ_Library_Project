# EZ Library project.
This project developed using Wpf(.Net FW 4.8). 
What I learned from this project:
- Using OOP development principles.
- Using sw architecture- MVVMLight, IOC, working with Views and ViewModels.
- Connecting the SW to DB and describe the entities and relationhips using ORM library: EntityFramework6. (Code-first approach).
- Db versioning and migrations.
- Unit tests.
